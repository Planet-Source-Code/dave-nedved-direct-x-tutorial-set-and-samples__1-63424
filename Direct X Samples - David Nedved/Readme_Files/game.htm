<p align="center" class="style2">3D Game Opportunity </p>
<p align="center" class="style1">I would like to create a Direct X based 3D Game kind of like  Halo in VB, or C++. I know right now that C++ is a better programming tool for  gaming, but I would prefer if vb could be used. This game would involve as many  advanced programmers that I can find that are interested in gaming, graphics, Mesh,  Cad, and sound. This may seem like a big project and it is, but I think that if  I could get a group of as many programmers that I can together to help with  this project we could pull it off. I have been researching DirectX and Open GL  for visual basic for about 1 and a half years now, and it is possible to pull  off a game with industry standard quality graphics in visual basic. Basically  what I am asking is would any programmers here on PSC be interested in helping  tackling this massive project with me. I&rsquo;m not entirely sure how we would go  about producing the game yet but the game could be Free or it could be sold, or  we could make it Open Source here on PSC. As for now I think that I will post  what I have learnt about DirectX and VB online in the next few days and if this  project can go ahead, every one on the PSC community that is into gaming could  benefit from what will be learn during this project.</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">If you have any comments, ideas etc please leave them below.  I am also open for storylines etc.. There are already about 4 people that are  helping in this project (from the 27/11/2005) and I have access to massive Sound  Libraries, and Recording studios. But I am keen for as many people that know  what there doing to get onboard as possible.</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">If you are interested in helping in this project please  email me so that I can get to know you etc..</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">Yours, David Nedved</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">p.s. Some people will think that this is a silly idea, but I  do not know how to go about it.. And I know that there are a bunch of good  gaming programmers here on PSC, and it would be worth it if we could come up  with something here that is fun, and will help others at the same time.</p>
